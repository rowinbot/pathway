# Pathway packages tsconfig directory

This directory contains the tsconfig files for the packages in this repository. All the config files are named `tsconfig.json` to preserver IDE intellisense for the keys in the config files. The config files are differentiated by their location in the directory structure:

- `base/tsconfig.json` - The base config file that all other config files extend from.
- `astro/tsconfig.json` - The config file for the web app.
